AddressBarMenu is the little vert icon
AddressBar Refresh is the icon to the left of the vert icon

search function basically just makes a call to getSettings(), which is currently broken

Anyone know how to add a type definition to "ref"?? --see AddressBarTextBox in addressBarStatus for what i'm talking about

TODO: address bar menu is currently an electron-only construct -- need to move it to web with platform handlers
